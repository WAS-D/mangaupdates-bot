# MangaUpdates Bot
A Discord bot that can be used to keep track of your favorite mangas using MongoDB and mangaupdates.com.

> **Note**: This bot is still in development. Many more features are coming in the near future.

## Invite

You can invite the MangaUpdates bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=880694914365685781&scope=bot&permissions=268856384).

## Features

- Send manga updates to you through discord DMs or in a server channel.
- Import MyAnimeList manga list to be tracked (In development).

## Why?

Personally, I read quite a bit of manga, manhwa, and doujins However, MyAnimeList doesn't want to track any less popular mangas as well as basically all manhwas and doujins.

I wanted to create something that would track all my mangas/manhwas/doujins on a platform that I personally use often on both desktop and mobile. Thus, I created this bot as Discord is cross-platform and I use it quite a lot to chat and has a very easy to use interface.

## Commands

You can see all commands within the bot with the `+help` command.
